-IMDb TV Show Ratings Analysis
-Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between IMDb votes and ratings for TV shows during television’s "Golden Age" (1999–present). The goal is to determine whether higher-rated TV shows also receive more votes, which would suggest stronger audience engagement or popularity.
The dataset contains records of both movies and TV shows. This project focuses on TV shows only and includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and insights generation using Python.

-Features & Functionality
Data Cleaning: Addressed issues like inconsistent column names, missing values, and incorrect data types.
Filtering & Aggregation: Filtered out movies and focused only on TV shows; grouped and summarized relevant statistics.
Correlation Analysis: Explored the relationship between IMDb scores and vote counts.
Visualization: Used histograms, scatter plots, and trend lines to present key findings.

-Key Insights
Highly-rated shows tend to have more IMDb votes, confirming a loose correlation between audience approval and engagement.
Certain genres consistently show strong performance in both ratings and votes.
Data preprocessing was crucial due to messy formatting and missing values.

-Tools & Libraries
Python
pandas
matplotlib / seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

-Requirements
Python 3.8+
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn

-Roadmap
Fix inconsistent column naming using .str.lower() and .str.replace() to standardize schema.
Add genre-level breakdown analysis to detect high-performing genres by votes/ratings.
Deploy as an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly Dash.
Integrate IMDb API to enrich dataset with real-time data.
