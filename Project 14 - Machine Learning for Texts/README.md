##Project Name
Movie Review Classification: Negative Review Detection

##Description
This project involves building a model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The dataset used comes from IMDB, with polarity labels indicating whether a review is positive or negative. The goal is to develop a model that can automatically detect negative reviews, with an objective of achieving an F1 score of at least 0.85.

The project follows these key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset to make it suitable for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset, including the distribution of labels and key features.

Model Building: Use machine learning models to classify the reviews and compute the F1 score.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy.

Tools used:

Python for data processing and model building.

pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation.

##System Requirements
Python 3.x (recommendation: 3.7 or higher)

pandas >= 1.1.0

NumPy >= 1.18.0

Matplotlib >= 3.0.0

Seaborn >= 0.10.0

scikit-learn >= 0.23.0

##Roadmap for Improvement
Increase model performance:

Experiment with advanced models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or BERT for text classification.

Implement hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the models for better performance.

Data Augmentation:

Implement text augmentation techniques like paraphrasing or back-translation to increase the dataset size.

Deep Learning:

Train a deep learning model (such as an LSTM or Transformer-based model) for more accurate text classification.

Model Deployment:

Create a simple API using Flask or FastAPI to deploy the model for real-time predictions.
