I am assuming that is because video game developers try to create games in the categories that are likely to make the most revenue since they have the best chance of making money. Of course the genres with the most games also tend to have the most sales. The more games you release the more revenue you can generate. The 3rd, 4th and 5th genres with the most games generate the 2nd, 3rd and 1st best average sales per game."

Japan's sales are very different with the Nintendo DS leading the way then the Playstation, then PS2 then Super Nintendo Entertainment System then the 3DS. Japan's platforms sales are heavily favored towards more Nintendo products, since Nintendo was founded in Japan it is much more popular in that culture. Sony (who makes Playstation) has 2 platforms in the top 5 is also an Japanese company. It is interesting the Wii did not break into Japan's top platforms given the immense popularity of the product in the rest of the world. Two of Japan's top 5 highest platforms and its platforms with the most sales were portable gaming platforms (DS & 3DS). While North America only had one handheld platform in its top 5 and it was 5th (DS). Europe did not have any handheld platforms in its top 5."

For Japan 'Role Playing' was by the far the highest selling genre, over 2x more sales in that genre than the 2nd most popular one. Role-playing was not even in the top 5 for the other two regions. Different games are tailored for different platforms, therefore it is not surprising to see the genre lists be different since the platform lists were.
