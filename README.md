# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Basic Python | In this project, I worked with data from the entertainment industry. I studied a dataset with records on movies and shows. The research focuses on the "Golden Age" of television, which began in 1999 with the release of The Sopranos and is still ongoing.  The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows (we will focus on TV shows, ignoring movies) released during the "Golden Age" of television also have the most votes. |
| 2 | [Instacart](https://github.com/zarina-perez/TripleTen_projects/tree/main/02-EDA_project) | The project task was to prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers |
| 3 | A/A/B Test Analysis | The project task was to study the sales funnel and analyze the results of an A/B test for a food startup. |
| 4 | Machine Learning Customer Interaction Strategies | The project task was to help a chain of fitness clubs develop a customer retention strategy. |
