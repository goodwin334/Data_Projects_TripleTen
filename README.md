# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Basic Python | In this project, I worked with data from the entertainment industry. I studied a dataset with records on movies and shows.  The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows (we will focus on TV shows, ignoring movies) released during the "Golden Age" of television also have the most votes. |
| 2 | Exploratory Data Analysis | The project task was to prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.  First we cleaned the data and analyzed it then prepared graphs and plots to communicate our results. |
| 3 | Statistical Data Analysis | The project's goal was to mimic working as an analyst for a telecom operator.  The company offers two prepaid plans, the goal of the project was to see which plan brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. |
| 4 | Software Development Tools | The project aimed to provide additional practice on common software engineering tasks like developing and deploying a web application to a cloud service so it is accessible to the public. |
| 5 | Integrated Project 1 | The project mimicked working for an online store which sells video games all over the world.  The data contained expert reviews, genres, platforms and historical data on sales.  The goal was to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not which will allow the company to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. |
| 6 | Data Collection and Storage (SQL) | The goal of the project was to combine files in SQL then identify the most commons routes and neighborhoods in the data.  Then graphically present the findings and test the hypotheses. |
| 7 | Introduction to Machine Learning | The project's goal was to analyze customers who used a legacy plan then study their behavior to recommend one of the companies newer plans.  We were required to develop a classification model with the highest accuracy possible. |
| 8 | Supervised Learning | The project was focused on analyzing a bank's customers as each month they were losing more and more.  The bank figured it would be cheaper to save existing customers rather than to attract new ones.  The goal was to predict whether a customer would be leaving the bank soon based on the clients' past behavior by building a model with a maximum possible F1 score. |
| 9 | Machine Learning in Business | The project mimicked working for a mining company and as an analyst your task was to find the best place for a new well.  The data was filled with oil samples from various regions and the oil wells in those regions.  The goal was to build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin for building a new well using bootstrapping technique. |
| 10 | Integrated Project 2 | The project focused on building a prototype of a machine learning model for a company.  The commpany develops efficiency solutions for the heavy mining industry.  The models goal was to predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore.  The project required me to analyze the entire gold extraction process and look into various stages of it.  Then use an evaulation metric to analyze how well the coefficient predicts the share of gold in the concentrate and the tails during each stage of the process. |
| 11 | Linear Algebra | The project aimed at solving several tasks for an insurance company using Machine Learning.  The tasks included finding customers who are similar to a given customer, predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit, predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model and protect the client's personal data without breaking the model. |
| 12 | Numerical Methods | In this project the goal was to develop an app for a used car service the quickly predicts the market value of a car.  The car service was interested in the quality of the prediction, the speed of the prediction and the time required for training. |
| 13 | Time Series | The project works with a taxi company who has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports.  The company wants to attract more drivers during peak hours, the goal was to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. |
| 14 | Machine Learning for Texts | A community of classic movie critics wants to develop a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews.  The goal of the project was to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews and predict it was an F1 score of at least 0.85. |
| 15 | Computer Vision | The project focused on working with a supermarket chain to explore whether data science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they are not selling alcohol to people underage.  The goal was to develop a model that will verify peoples age using the cameras at checkout. |
| 16 | Unsupervised Learning | The chapter focused on searching for anomalies in one-dimensional data by using boxplots, detect outliers in multidimensional data by utilizing the isolation forest algorithm and find anomalies in multidimensional data by using the KNN method. |
| 17 | Final Project | The project's goal was to build a prototype of a machine learning model that will forecast a telecom operators churn of clients.  If we discover someone is about to leave we offer promotional codes and special plan options. |
