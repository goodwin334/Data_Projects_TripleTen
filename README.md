# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Basic Python | In this project, I worked with data from the entertainment industry. I studied a dataset with records on movies and shows. The research focuses on the "Golden Age" of television, which began in 1999 with the release of The Sopranos and is still ongoing.  The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows (we will focus on TV shows, ignoring movies) released during the "Golden Age" of television also have the most votes. |
| 2 | Exploratory Data Analysis | The project task was to prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.  First we cleaned the data and analyzed it then prepared graphs and plots to communicate our results. |
| 3 | Statistical Data Analysis | The project's goal was to mimic working as an analyst for a telecom operator.  The company offers two prepaid plans, the goal of the project was to which plan brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. |
| 4 | Software Development Tools | The project aimed to provide additional practice on common software engineering tasks like developing and deploying a web application to a cloud service so it is accessible to the public. |
| 5 | Integrated Project 1 | The project mimiced working for an online store which sells video games all over the world.  The data contained expert reviews, genres, platforms and historical data on sales.  The goal was to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not which will allow the company to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. |
